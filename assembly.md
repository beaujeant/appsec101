# Assembly

Assembly is a vast topic. We could spend hours, days, month and we still would have more to say about. Nevertheless, this is not a reverse engineering course and Iâ€™m myself not particularly fluent in assembly, so this course will cover the bare minimum to understand and exploit the vulnerabilities listed for this course, i.e. buffer overflow, format string, use after free and integer over/underflow.
